Oh, oh
Oh

분명 나쁜 아이는 아니어도
또 틀에 가두면, we break it
Bum, no bigger than the girl next door
무대 서면, we fake it
No white collar, 근데 얜 좀 쳐
When I put mans in their places
모든 시선들은 날 따라와
But we ain't even famous

Don't you try me, I want some more
Don't you play me, we on the floor
Don't you try me, I want some more
We ain't even famous
Don't you try me, I want some more
Don't you play me, we on the floor
Don't you try me, I want some more
We ain't even famous

Money don't make friends, only got my fam
Pull up with my M's and I make thе money dance
Funny how it goes, but this is how it еnds
This is how I live by the name Tarzzan
I ain't even famous
다들 날 보면 오, they say less
And my kit in my whip is the latest
내 가친 조 단위 임마 불러봐, name is The Greatest Unfamous

느껴져 내 분위기
When I walk, 다 돌아봐
I be gettin' what I need
Those things I've got
Think it's going to my head
Know you lookin' when I dance
Take a quick pic for your friend
내 이름 알아둬

분명 나쁜 아이는 아니어도

Bum, no bigger than the girl next door
무대 서면, we fake it
No white collar, 근데 얜 좀 쳐
When I put mans in their places
모든 시선들은 날 따라와
But we ain't even famous

I'm stacking my dollars, 난 뿌리부터 달라
초록 빛깔 color, 감출 수 없어, 나잖아 빛이
Not even famous, but they wanna be us
같은 공기지만 우린 너무 다른 위치
비교 말어 걔넨 전부 구려
똑같은 걸 해도, I do it better
말해 뭐해, I'm a trendsetter
ALLDAY, I show 'em, 끝없는 체력

내 표적은 네 머리
When I walk, 다 돌아봐
I be gettin' what I need
Those things I've got
Think it's going to my head
Know you lookin' when I dance
Take a quick pic for your friend
내 이름 알아둬

분명 나쁜 아이는 아니어도
또 틀에 가두면, we break it
범 무서운지 모르고 덤벼
겁 없이, I just face it
No white collar, 근데 얜 좀 쳐
When I put mans in their places
모든 시선들은 날 따라와
But we ain't even famous (We ain't even famous)
