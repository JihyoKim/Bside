  [Intro]
  Hey, hey
  Hey, hey
  Hey
  
  [Verse 1: Jinu]
  Don't want you, need you
  Yeah, I need you to fill me up
  마시고 마셔 봐도
  성에 차지 않아
  Got a feeling that, oh, yeah (Yeah)
  You could be everything that
  That I need (Need), taste so sweet (Sweet)
  Every sip makes me want more, yeah
  
  [Verse 2: Mystery, Romance, Abby]
  Lookin' like snacks 'cause you got it like that (Woo)
  Take a big bite, want another bite, yeah
  너의 모든 걸 난 원해, 원해, 원해
  너 말곤 모두 뻔해, 뻔해, 뻔해
  When you're in my arms, I hold you so tight (So tight)
  Can't let go, no, no, not tonight
  
  [Pre-Chorus: Jinu, Romance, All, Baby]
  지금 당장 날 봐 시간 없잖아
  넌 내꺼야 이미 알고 있잖아
  'Cause I need you to need me
  I'm empty, you feed me so refreshing
  My little soda pop

  [Chorus: All]
You're all I can think of
Every drop I drink up
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop
Cool me down, you're so hot
Pour me up, I won't stop
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop

[Post-Chorus: All]
My little soda pop

[Verse 3: Baby, Abby]
Uh, make me wanna flip the top
한 모금에 you hit the spot
Every little drip and drop, fizz and pop, ah
소름 돋아 it's gettin' hot
Yes, I'm sippin' when it's drippin' now
It's done? I need a second round
And pour a lot and don't you stop
'Til my soda pop fizzles out

[Pre-Chorus: Romance, Mystery, Abby, Romance & Mystery]
꿈 속에 그려왔던 너
난 절대 놓칠 수 없어
널 원해 꼭
I waited so long for a taste of soda
So, the wait is over, baby
Come and fill me up
Just can't get enough
Oh


[Chorus: All]
You're all I can think of
Every drop I drink up
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop (Yeah, yeah)
Cool me down, you're so hot
Pour me up, I won't stop (Oh, oh)
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop

[Outro: Jinu]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You're my soda pop
Gotta drink every drop
